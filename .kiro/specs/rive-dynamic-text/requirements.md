# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable dynamic text updates in Rive animations at runtime using the direct Rive API. The implementation will focus on a dialogue system where text content is managed entirely within the application's JavaScript codebase and fed into the Rive animation when needed. This approach provides flexibility for content management, localization, and easy updates without modifying the Rive file.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to dynamically update text elements in a Rive animation from my JavaScript code, so that I can manage dialogue content outside of the Rive editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over any of the six characters in the Rive animation THEN the system SHALL display a dialogue box with character-specific text.
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL load dialogue text from a JavaScript data structure rather than from within the Rive file.
3. WHEN text content needs to be updated THEN the system SHALL allow changes to be made in the JavaScript code without requiring modifications to the Rive file.
4. WHEN the application is initialized THEN the system SHALL properly connect to the named text runs in the Rive file.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want dialogue text to be stored in a maintainable format in the codebase, so that I can easily update or localize content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dialogue content needs to be modified THEN the system SHALL only require changes to a JavaScript object or JSON file.
2. WHEN the application supports multiple languages THEN the system SHALL allow for easy swapping of text content based on the selected language.
3. WHEN new characters are added to the animation THEN the system SHALL support adding new dialogue entries without complex code changes.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tutorial reader, I want clear instructions for both the Rive editor setup and JavaScript implementation, so that I can successfully implement dynamic text in my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following the tutorial THEN the user SHALL receive clear instructions on how to set up and name text runs in the Rive editor.
2. WHEN implementing the code THEN the user SHALL have access to complete, copy-paste-friendly code examples.
3. WHEN reading the tutorial THEN the user SHALL understand the key API call for updating text content (setTextRunValue).
4. WHEN implementing the solution THEN the user SHALL be able to adapt the code to their specific project needs.
