Separate Development (orbit.js + orbit.html), then Combine:
Pros:
Simplicity & Focus: Allows you to develop the orbit animation logic cleanly and independently, without worrying about the particle simulation.
Modularity: Keeps the code for each distinct visual effect separate and self-contained. This is much better practice.
Easier Debugging: Issues can be isolated to either the energy or orbit system.
Clearer Combination Strategy: Once both work independently, the simplest way to "combine" them visually is often at the HTML/CSS level. You can have two separate canvases within the same parent container, positioned absolutely to overlay each other. Each canvas would be driven by its respective script (energy.js for one, orbit.js for the other). This avoids merging complex WebGL rendering logic.
Cons: Requires creating new files initially.
Recommendation:
I strongly recommend the separate development approach. Creating orbit.js and orbit.html (leveraging the existing style.css) is the cleanest, most scalable, and least error-prone path. It adheres to the principle of keeping code modular and focused.
Proposed Plan:
Create orbit.js: This file will manage the Three.js setup (scene, camera, renderer, lights) and the logic specifically for creating and animating the sun, planet, moons, orbits, day marks, and radar signal.
Create orbit.html: This file will be the testing ground. It will contain:
An HTML structure similar to energy.html (<div id="container">, <canvas id="simulationCanvas">, <div id="controls">).
HTML controls (color pickers, toggles, sliders) specific to the orbit animation parameters (based on your design image).
Link to style.css for consistent UI appearance.
A <script type="module"> block to import and initialize the orbit scene from orbit.js and connect the UI controls to update functions within orbit.js.
Develop Orbit Animation: Implement the visual elements and animation logic within orbit.js.
Refine Controls: Wire up all the controls in orbit.html to modify the animation parameters in orbit.js in real-time.
"Integration" Phase (Later): Once both energy.js and orbit.js are independently functional and controllable, we can discuss the strategy for using them together in a production environment like Webflow. This will likely involve:
A wrapper HTML element.
Two distinct canvas elements (or containers where the scripts create canvases) inside the wrapper.
CSS to position the orbit canvas visually on top of the energy canvas.
Initializing both scripts independently, targeting their respective canvases/containers.

You've hit on a key architectural question: integrate directly into the existing energy.js/energy.html or develop the orbit animation separately first in its own files (orbit.js/orbit.html) and then combine them.
