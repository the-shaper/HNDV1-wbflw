# TwilightFringe Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Issues
1. Multiple animation loops running simultaneously
2. High canvas resolution without DPI consideration
3. Inefficient resource loading
4. No frame rate limiting
5. Potential shader optimization opportunities
6. No visibility-based pausing

## Optimization Tasks

### 1. Animation System Optimization âœ…
- [x] Consolidate animation loops into a single loop
- [x] Implement proper cleanup of animation frames
- [x] Add frame rate limiting (target: 30-60fps)
- [x] Add visibility-based pausing

### 2. Canvas & Renderer Optimization (Partially Complete)
- [x] Implement proper DPI scaling
- [x] Set appropriate pixel ratio
- [x] Add renderer performance settings
  ```javascript
  // Already implemented in Phase 1
  renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2));
  renderer.antialias = true; // Consider disabling if not needed
  renderer.powerPreference = 'high-performance';
  renderer.precision = 'mediump'; // Added in Phase 1
  ```

### 3. Shader Optimization
- [ ] Profile shader performance
- [ ] Optimize complex calculations
- [ ] Use lower precision where possible
- [ ] Consider using lookup textures for expensive calculations
- [ ] Implement level-of-detail (LOD) for shaders

### 4. Resource Management
- [ ] Implement proper resource cleanup
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Implement resource pooling if applicable
- [ ] Optimize texture sizes and formats

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add performance stats overlay
- [ ] Implement frame time tracking
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Create performance budget tracking

### 6. Responsive Design
- [ ] Optimize for different screen sizes
- [ ] Implement resolution scaling based on device capabilities
- [ ] Add mobile-specific optimizations

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Wins (1-2 hours)
1. Consolidate animation loops
2. Implement DPI scaling and pixel ratio
3. Add visibility-based pausing

### Phase 2: Core Optimizations (2-4 hours)
1. Implement frame rate limiting
2. Optimize shaders
3. Add performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (4+ hours)
1. Implement LOD system
2. Add resource pooling
3. Advanced shader optimizations

## Performance Metrics to Track
- FPS (Frames Per Second)
- Frame time (ms)
- GPU memory usage
- CPU usage
- Time to interactive
- First contentful paint

## Testing Plan
1. Test on multiple devices (desktop, mobile, low-end)
2. Test with different screen sizes
3. Test with multiple instances
4. Test under CPU/GPU stress
5. Test with browser dev tools throttling

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep a backup of the original implementation
2. Implement feature flags for toggling optimizations
3. Document known issues and workarounds

## Future Considerations
- WebGL 2.0 features
- WebWorker for offloading calculations
- WebAssembly for performance-critical code
- Progressive enhancement based on device capabilities
