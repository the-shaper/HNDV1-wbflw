### 1 - Dani
- We were fans before creators, and we still are. In the beginning we created for the fuck of it, and we still do. We need no permission to chase a vision.

### 2 - Inia
- We are generators, we are nerds. We tinker and play and build things at the edges. Weird today, cool tomorrow.

###  3 - Clara 
- We are radars. Senses and mind tuning in to the source. We collect dots, find hidden harmonies and build bridges between imagination and form. 
### 4 - Path
- We see the world as potential, not as what is but what could be. We thrive in the unknown, blazing paths where there are none, tracing new maps of humanity.
###  5 - Poet
- We are poets. Weavers of meaning, victims of beauty, endlessly chasing the muse. Some say we make things up, telling lies for a living, and it is true, but the deeper truth lies between the lines.
### 6 - Lou
- We feel deep, we believe in magic. We long for awe, connection, pure and unfiltered self expression.
